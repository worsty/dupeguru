I accidentally added several dupes to my Ignore List. I want to clear this list and rerun my scan to include those dupes. I cannot figure out how to clear or delete the ignore list so those music files will show up again. I am using DupeGuru Music. I tried, selecting “View”, “Ignore List” but it is blank. I clicked on “Clear” even though nothing was showing in the ignore list, but it still will not find any of the Duplicates i accidentally added to the Ignore List. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Dupe Guru Music Program but it still will not work, the Ignore List file must still be hidden somewhere on my laptop. Any suggestions?
